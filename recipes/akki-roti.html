    <p>Akki Roti is a flatbread made with rice flour, spices, herbs and vegetables. 
        These are a popular Breakfast from Karnataka Cuisine. “Akki” is a 
        Kannada word meaning “rice” and “roti” are “flatbreads”. So Akki 
        roti translates to rice roti. These are not only gluten-free but also delicious 
        & easy to make. Akki rotti are usually eaten with coconut chutney, 
        but any other chutney, Sagu or mixed vegetable curry goes well.
